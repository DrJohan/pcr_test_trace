### Overview


### PCR screening of quarantined people

* Time-varying detection probability [@Kucirka2020]
* Asymptomatics more difficult to detect [@VanVinhChau2020]
* How long does quarantine need to be?
* When is best time to test?
* Does testing twice help?

### PCR screening of quarantined people

![](figures/contact_tracing_diagram.png)

Figure: Diagram showing the exposure of an index case and their transmission to two individuals, causing a symptomatic and an asymptomatic case. The darkness of the bar corresponds to transmission potential.



### PCR screening -- model

1. Simulate infectious index cases
2. Generate secondary cases for each index
3. 1, 2 or 3 days after onset, index case seeks a test and quarantines
4. Simulate delays for
    - index case's test result return - 1 day (0.2, 2.7)
    - contact sourcing - 0.5 days (0, 2.8) 
    - contact tracing - 0.4 days (0, 2.3)
5. Secondary cases isolate immediately

Calculate transmission potential occurring:

* prior to quarantine
* during quarantine (infectivity averted)
* after quarantine

NB we assume no infectivity prior to exposure or 14 days after onset of symptoms and rescale appropriately


### PCR screening -- model

|     |  Low | Moderate | High | Maximum |
| :-- | :--  | :--      | :--  | :--     |
| Mandatory quarantine (MQ) | N | 3,5,7,9 days | 14 days | 14 days |
| Always testing      | N | N | Y | N |
| Time of first test | 0 days | End of MQ | 0,1,2,3 days | End of MQ | 
| Time from first to second test | - | - | 2,4,6 days | - |
| Delay for secondary case's test result | 1 day | 1 day | 1 day | 1 day | 
| Early release | N | N | 2 neg. | N |

### PCR screening - discussion

**Quarantine is highly effective**

We find that 14-day quarantine with no test can be 99% effective on average in preventing infectious arrivals entering the community.

**PCR could reduce quarantine duration if timing is right**

Compared to relying only on syndromic screening at departure

| Quarantine | Effectiveness | 
| :--- | :---: |
| 14 days | 99% |
| 8 days (test on 7) | 94% |
| 6 days (test on 5) | 88% |
| Test on arrival | ~ 45% | 

Tests should be paired with quarantine of at least 5 days to account for onset of symptoms and detectability via PCR



### PCR screening - discussion



**Double testing provides only a marginal benefit**

> Compared to same quarantine with test at end, additional intermediate tests donâ€™t do much to prevent risk.

**Short quarantines are not effective**

> Infections are difficult to detect early on.

> Testing too early means individuals with a latent infection could transmit after release

**Reducing delays is crucial to effective quarantine**
