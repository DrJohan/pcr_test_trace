### PCR screening of quarantined people

* Key questions
    * Can quarantine be shorter than 14 days?
    * When is best time to test?
    * Does testing twice help?

* Key challenges
    * Time-varying PCR detection probability [@Kucirka2020]
    * Time-varying infectivity [@He2020; @Ashcroft2020]
    * Asymptomatics more difficult to detect [@VanVinhChau2020]

<!-- Figure: Diagram showing the exposure of an index case and their transmission to two individuals, causing a symptomatic and an asymptomatic case. The darkness of the bar corresponds to transmission potential. -->



### PCR screening -- model

1. Simulate infectious index cases
2. Generate secondary cases for each index
3. Index case seeks a test and isolates 1, 2 or 3 days after onset
4. Simulate delays for 
    - index case's test result return - avg 1.1 day (95% 0.2 days, 2.7 days)
    - contact sourcing - 0.8 days (0, 2.8) 
    - contact tracing - 0.6 days (0, 2.3)
    - total delay = 2.5 (0.8, 5.3)
5. Secondary cases isolate immediately, seek a test, and adhere to quarantine

* Calculate transmission potential occurring:
    * prior to quarantine
    * during quarantine (infectivity averted)
    * after quarantine

* NB we assume no infectivity prior to exposure or 14 days after onset of symptoms and rescale appropriately

### PCR screening - discussion

* **Variability in results**
    - Due to long incubation period in index and secondary cases
    - Longer delays to index case's test exacerbates this
    - Additional variation from delays in contact tracing

* **PCR could reduce quarantine duration if timing is right**
    - Need to test late enough that virus is detectable
    - Quarantining secondary cases as soon as traced is crucial
    - 10 days with test on day 9 $\approx$ 14 days quarantine with no test


* **Considerations** 
    - Will a shorter quarantine time improve adherence? [@Webster2020]
    - How can delays be made shorter?
